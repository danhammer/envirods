# # Lab 1: Basic operations
# 
# This is not going to be easy, especially for students with no experience in Python.  But that's what Thursdays are for! As a reminder, the labs are graded along the following four dimensions:
# 
# 1. **Execution**. There are no errors in executing the Notebook cells.
# 2. **Narrative**. Jupyter Notebooks are half code and half narrative prose. The integrated code should just be an illustration of the text.  Explain what you're doing!
# 3. **Creativity**. You are able to find interesting patterns in the data.
# 4. **Presentation**. Where there are maps and graphs, they are presented nicely.
# 
# Even though the code will speak for itself for these questions, explain what you're doing in the **Text** cells.
# 
# 1. Create a `DataFrame` of random numbers with 100 rows and 4 columns. Name the columns `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
# 2. Create a scatter plot of column a against b. Set the size of each point on the scatterplot based on a new variable `adev`, which records the deviations of `a` from the average value of `a`.
