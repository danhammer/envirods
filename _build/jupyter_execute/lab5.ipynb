    "\n",
    "This lab will focus exclusively on carbon emissions from the aviation sector, using the following dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danhammer/envirods/main/data/aviation.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a map of the 100 airports with the most flights in 2021, where the color or size of the point is determined by the number of flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a chloropleth map of the total emissions from the aviation sector by country.  Resecale the emissions so that the colors shows some variation (i.e., use `numpy.log` to rescale).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a line chart that shows the time series of emissions over time for 4 major airports of your choosing.  Create another one with fuel consumption for those airports.  Bonus if you can do this within a function, where a list of four airports is the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For the top 20 airports with the most emissions in 2019, create a table that is sorted by airports with the greatest proportionate decrease in emissions from 2019 to 2020 (i.e., change in emissions over total 2019 emissions).\n"
