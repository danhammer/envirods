# ### Lab 6: Emissions aggregations and comparisons
# 
# This lab will focus exclusively on carbon emissions from the steel sector, using the following dataset:
# 
# `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danhammer/envirods/main/data/steel.geojson`
# 
# 1. Create a _single_ chart that shows (a) annual emissions from the steel sector in China since 2018; and (b) annual emissions from the rest of the world since 2018. (Hint: stacked bar chart is the one of the easiest ways to answer this question, given what we learned in lecture.)  Bonus if you can do this by _month_ since January 2018.
# 2. What proportion of steel emissions since 2019 have come from the top 20 highest-emitting facilities in the world over that timeframe?
